# Super-Duo
This project includes two projects: 
1. Alexandria - A book list and barcode scanner app. I have included a barcode scanner(The Barcode Scanner code for Mobile Vision is utilized from Google Samples at https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision/tree/master/visionSamples/barcode-reader) and fixed two crashes.
2. Football Scores - An app that tracks current/future soccer matches.  I have made it RTL compatible and added a widget to view upcoming games
